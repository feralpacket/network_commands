! error counters and what they mean
 - work in progress


! "show interface" error counters

 - output hang
 - Input queue - drops
 - Inpus queue - flushes
 - Total output drops
 - no buffer
 - runts
 - giants
 - throttles
 - input errors
 - CRC
 - frame

 - overrun
   - "Overrun counter accounts number of times the receiver hardware was unable to hand received data to a hardware buffer. In other words, the input rate of traffic exceeded the ability of the receiver to handle the data."
   - "A Catalyst 6500 might experience interface overrun when a Layer 2 Distributed Etherchannel (DEC) is configured. DEC is an etherchannel across 2 or more Distriubuted Forwarding Card (DFC) modules. An Etherchannel with 2 member interfaces connected on the same linecard but on different fabric channels is not considered a DEC."
   - "Overrun counter can start  incrementing when the fabric utilization reaches about 50%." - On 6500s.
   - "overrun (drops) are happening on ingress due to ingress flow control."
