 - work in progress


! "show interface" error counters

 - output hang
   - "Number of hours, minutes, and seconds (or never) since the interface was last reset because of a transmission that took too long. When the number of hours in any of the “last” fields exceeds 24 hours, the number of days and hours is displayed. If that field overflows, asterisks are printed"
   - https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/interface/command/ir-cr-book/ir-s5.html

 - Input queue - drops
   - "Drops--Number of packets dropped because of a full input queue."
   - https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/interface/command/ir-cr-book/ir-s5.html
 
 - Inpus queue - flushes
   - "Flushes--Number of packets dropped as part of SPD. SPD implements a selective packet drop"
   - https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/interface/command/ir-cr-book/ir-s5.html

- Total output drops
   - "Output drops are generally a result of interface oversubscription caused by many to one or a 10Gbps to 1Gps transfer. Interface buffers are a limited resource and can only absorb a burst up to a point after which packets start to drop. Buffers can be tuned to give some cushion but it cannot guarantee a zero output drop scenario."
   - https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/switches/catalyst-9500-series-switches/218397-troubleshoot-port-flaps-on-catalyst-9000.html
   - "Total number of packets dropped because of a full output queue."
   - https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/interface/command/ir-cr-book/ir-s5.html

 - no buffer

 - runts
   - "Number of packets that are discarded because they are smaller than the minimum packet size of the medium."
   - https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/interface/command/ir-cr-book/ir-s5.html

 - giants
   - "Received packets larger than the configured MTU."
   - https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/switches/catalyst-9500-series-switches/217233-troubleshoot-mtu-on-catalyst-9000-series.html
   - "Intermediate System-to-Intermediate System (IS-IS) adjacencies do not come up. By default, IS-IS uses hello-padding; therefore, hellos might be characterized as giants and might be dropped when one router has an MTU value that is lower than the values at the other routers."
   - "Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) adjacencies get stuck in Exstart or Exchange state, because large database descriptor (DBD) packets might be characterized as giants and might be dropped. When the packets are received on a router with a lower MTU value, the databases are not synchronized."
   - https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ios-nx-os-software/ios-xr-software/116350-trouble-ios-xr-mtu-00.html

 - throttles
   - "Number of times the receiver on the port was disabled, possibly because of buffer or processor overload."
   - https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/interface/command/ir-cr-book/ir-s5.html

 - input errors
   - "This includes runts, giants, no buffer, CRC, frame, overrun, and ignored counts. Other input-related errors can also cause the input errors count to be increased."
   - https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/switches/catalyst-9500-series-switches/218397-troubleshoot-port-flaps-on-catalyst-9000.html
   - "and some datagrams may have more than one error; therefore, this sum may not balance with the sum of enumerated input error counts."
   - https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/interface/command/ir-cr-book/ir-s5.html

 - CRC
   - "A high number of CRCs is usually the result of collisions but can also indicate a physical issue (such as cabling, SFP, bad interface or NIC) or a duplex mismatch"
   - https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/switches/catalyst-9500-series-switches/218397-troubleshoot-port-flaps-on-catalyst-9000.html
   - "Cyclic redundancy check generated by the originating LAN station or far-end device does not match the checksum calculated from the data received. On a LAN, this usually indicates noise or transmission problems on the LAN interface or the LAN bus itself. A high number of CRCs is usually the result of collisions or a station transmitting bad data."
   - https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/interface/command/ir-cr-book/ir-s5.html

 - frame
   - "Number of packets received incorrectly having a CRC error and a noninteger number of octets. On a LAN, this is usually the result of collisions or a malfunctioning Ethernet device."
   - https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/interface/command/ir-cr-book/ir-s5.html

 - overrun
   - "Overrun counter accounts number of times the receiver hardware was unable to hand received data to a hardware buffer. In other words, the input rate of traffic exceeded the ability of the receiver to handle the data."
   - "A Catalyst 6500 might experience interface overrun when a Layer 2 Distributed Etherchannel (DEC) is configured. DEC is an etherchannel across 2 or more Distriubuted Forwarding Card (DFC) modules. An Etherchannel with 2 member interfaces connected on the same linecard but on different fabric channels is not considered a DEC."
   - "Overrun counter can start  incrementing when the fabric utilization reaches about 50%." - On 6500s.
   - "overrun (drops) are happening on ingress due to ingress flow control."
   - "6500#show platform hardware capacity rewrite-engine performance slot 2"
   - https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/switches/catalyst-6500-series-switches/200089-Troubleshoot-Interface-Overrun-caused-by.html

 - ignored
   - "Number of received packets ignored by the interface because the interface hardware ran low on internal buffers. These buffers are different than the system buffers. Broadcast storms and bursts of noise can cause the ignored count to be increased."
   - https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/interface/command/ir-cr-book/ir-s5.html

 - underruns
   - "Number of times that the transmitter has been running faster than the router can handle."
   - https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/interface/command/ir-cr-book/ir-s5.html

- output errors
   - "This issue is due to the low output queue size or when there is oversubscription."
   - https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/switches/catalyst-9500-series-switches/218397-troubleshoot-port-flaps-on-catalyst-9000.html
   - "Sum of all errors that prevented the final transmission of datagrams out of the interface being examined. Note that this may not balance with the sum of the enumerated output errors, because some datagrams may have more than one error and others may have errors that do not fall into any of the specifically tabulated categories."
   - https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/interface/command/ir-cr-book/ir-s5.html

 - collisions
   - "Number of messages retransmitted because of an Ethernet collision. This is usually the result of an overextended LAN (Ethernet or transceiver cable too long, more than two repeaters between stations, or too many cascaded multiport transceivers). A packet that collides is counted only once in output packets."
   - https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/interface/command/ir-cr-book/ir-s5.html

 - interface resets
   - "Number of times an interface has been completely reset. This can happen if packets queued for transmission were not sent within several seconds. Interface resets can occur when an interface is looped back or shut down."
   - https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/interface/command/ir-cr-book/ir-s5.html

 - unknown protocol drops
   - "Unknown protocol drops are normally dropped because the interface where these packets are received is not configured for this type of protocol, or it can be any protocol that the switch does not recognize. For example, if you have two switches connected and you disable CDP on one switch interface, this results in unknown protocol drops on that interface. The CDP packets are no longer recognized, and they are dropped."
   - https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/switches/catalyst-9500-series-switches/218397-troubleshoot-port-flaps-on-catalyst-9000.html

 - babbles
   - "Transmit jabber timer expired."
   - https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/interface/command/ir-cr-book/ir-s5.html

 - late collision
   - "Number of late collisions. Late collision happens when a collision occurs after transmitting the preamble."
   - https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/interface/command/ir-cr-book/ir-s5.html

 - deferred
   - "Number of times that the interface had to defer while ready to transmit a frame because the carrier was asserted."
   - https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/interface/command/ir-cr-book/ir-s5.html

 - lost carrier
   - "Number of times the carrier was lost during transmission."
   - https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/interface/command/ir-cr-book/ir-s5.html

 - no carrier
   - "Number of times the carrier was not present during the transmission."
   - https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/interface/command/ir-cr-book/ir-s5.html

 - output buffer failures
   - "Number of output butters failures and output buffers swapped out."
