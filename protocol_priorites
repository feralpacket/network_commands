Generally, but not always:
 - Layer 2
     -> Lower is better
     -> PAgP port priority, higher is better
 - IGPs and layer 3
     -> Higher is better
     -> OSPF has an exception
     -> Of course, LISP has to be different
 - BGP
     -> There is a high / low cutoff
     -> Unless extcommunity cost pre-bestpath is configure
 - Multicast
     -> If the protocol has "Router" in the name, then higher is better
          -> Think "Router" -> "IGP"
     -> Otherwise, lower is better


 -The route selection process:
    -> Prefix length
        -> Longer prefixes are always preferred over shorter ones
    -> Administrative distance (AD)
       -> If prefix lengths are the same
       -> Lowest AD preferred
       -> Used to select the prefixes from different routing protocols to be installed into the routing table
       -> If for some reason you changed the AD to match that of another active routing protocol,
          the default AD for those two protocols is used
    -> Metrics / Attributes
       -> Each routing protocol uses metrics to determine most preferred to least preferred routes.
       -> Differ depending on the routing protocol
       -> Used to select candidate prefixes that may be installed into the routing table

    -> AD (Administrative Distance):
       -> Lower is better

         -> Extended system ID is equal to the VLAN ID
         -> The extended system ID is needed to use extended VLANs 1006 - 4094
         -> Note:  Some documentation may have warnings about connecting to older switches that do not support the extended system ID
         -> Note:  But the feature was added with IOS version 12.1(12c)EW on the Cisco 4500 swithes
     -> Switch priority

         -> Note:  The default method changed to long for Cisco 9300 switches with IOS XE 17.5.x
         -> Note:  With some Cisco 9500 switch models, the default method was changed to long with some IOS XE 16.x version
         -> Note:  For some reason, pathcost method short is still the default for NX-OS, even for Nexus9k switches that have 100G, 200G, and 400G interfaces
         -> Note:  When the NX-OS documentation says the default STP port cost for a VPC is 200 and you only see a port cost of 1 . . .
         -> Note:  Even after changing to pathcost method long, VPC peer-links have a port cost of 100, good job Cisco
         -> Note:  Verify with the documentation for your switch model and IOS version
         -> Patcost method short ( if the above notes confused you )
