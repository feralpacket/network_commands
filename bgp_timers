! BGP timers
 - advertisement
   - determines how quickly route updates propogate
   - defaults
     - eBGP sessions not in a VRF:  30 seconds
     - eBGP sessions in a VRF:  0 seconds
     - iBGP sessions:  0 seconds
   - range:  0 - 600 seconds
   - router bgp 64500
   -   add ipv4
   -     nei 192.0.2.1 advertisement-interval 5

- keepalive
   - determines how quickly software failures are detected
   - default:  60 seconds
   - recommended:  3 seconds
   - range:  0 - 65535 seconds
   - router bgp 64500
   -   nei 192.0.2.1 timers 3 9
   - timers bgp 3 9 0
   - timers configured for a specific neighbor or peer group override the "timers bgp" configuration
   - using BFD will cause session teardown and withdraws before the timers are exceeded
   - bfd interval 250 min-rx 250 multiplier 3
   - router bgp 64500
   -   neighbor 192.0.2.1 fall-over bfd
   - BGP fast external failover will cause the session to immediately reset if an interface goes down
   - bgp fast-external-failover
   - int gi0/0/0
   -   ip bgp fast-external-failover permit
   - int gi0/0/1
   -   ip bgp fact-external-failover deny

- hold time
   - determines how quickly software failures are detected
   - default:  180 secondes
   - recommended:  9 seconds
   - minimum holdtime (optional):  0 seconds
   - range:  0 - 65535 seconds
   - router bgp 64500
   -   nei 192.0.2.1 timers 3 9
   - timers bgp 3 9 0
   - timers configured for a specific neighbor or peer group override the "timers bgp" configuration
   - using BFD will cause session teardown and withdraws before the timers are exceeded

- retry time
   - determines how quickly a failed connection is retried
   - default:  120 seconds
   - recommended:  10 seconds
   - cannot be changed in Cisco
   - using BFD to detect failed connections

- scan time
   - the BGP scanner
   - default:  60 seconds
   - range:  5 - 60 seconds
     - in IOS XE 17.12.1
     - documentation says the range is 15 - 60 seconds
   - checks all validity and reachability of the NEXT_HOP attribute for a prefixes
   - performs conditional advertisement and route injection
   - imports new routes to the BGP table from the RIB with the network and redistribute commands
   - performs route dampening
   - the scan time is set to the default if BGP Next Hop Tracking (NHT) is configured
   - bgp scan-time 5

 - trigger delay
   - BGP next-hop tracking
   - default:  5 seconds
   - range:  0 100 seconds
   - checks on updated next-hop routes installed in the routing table
   - improves BGP convergence time by reducing the response time to hext-hop changes for routes installed in the RIB
   - when a best-path calculation is run in between BGP scanner cycles, only the changes are processed and tracked
   - an unstable IGP can introduce instability to BGP
   - when enabled, it's recommended to use the default of 5 seconds
   - bgp nexthop trigger 1
   - bgp nexthop trigger enable

- update delay
   - time from when a neighbor is established until the best path algorithm is run and updates are sent
   - default:  120 seconds
   - range:  0 - 3600 seconds
   - bgp update-delay 5
   - if set too low, can cause extra updates to be sent if a better path is received from another peer later
   - can be configured with Nonstop Forwarding (NSF)
   - bgp graceful-restart
   - affected by End-of-RIB marker with Graceful Restart
     - an UPDATE message with no NLRI and empty withdrawn NLRI
	 - RFC 8538 - Graceful Restart Mechanism for BGP
   - bgp refresh stalepath-time 600
   - bgp refresh max-eor-time 600
