! Cisco revert timer, instead of reload in 5

! Configure archive
en
conf t
archive
! path must be configured
! A directory called .rollback_timer will automatically be created to store temp files
! A copy of the config will be save as a dash-date-time-timezone file.
! bootflash:-Apr-01-20-16-02.005-UTC-1
! Change this to match the device, run "dir"
 path bootflash:
 end
!
archive config
sh archive

!  If everything is currently working, it's a good idea to save the current configuration
wr mem

! To set the revert timer in minutes, run show clock first
en
show clock
conf t revert timer 10
 <changes>
 end

! To accept the changes before they are reverted
! If you don't confirm the changes, they will be reverted when the timer is up
config confirm

! note, if shell processing full is used for reasons ( like using sleep when bouncing interfaces )
! and the rolled back configuration has a password or key with a $ in it, bad things will happen
! the $ will be seen as a variable instead of a password or key and that configuration line will error and not be applied
! ask me how I know.  actually, don't ask.

! To revert the changes right now
config revert
  -- or --
config revert now

! This will show when the revert timer was set and the timer value
sh archive config rollback timer
sh clock

! If you need more time in minutes
config revert timer 10
