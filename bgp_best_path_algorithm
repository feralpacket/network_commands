BGP Best Path Selection Algorithm
http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/border-gateway-protocol-bgp/13753-25.html

Why Routers Ignore Paths:
 - path are marked “not synchronized” in sh ip bgp longer-prefixes output
 - next hop is inaccessible or unreachable
 - path from eBGP neighbor has local AS in AS_PATH
 - bgp enforce-first-as is set and the update doesn’t list the neighbor AS as the first AS
 - paths are marked “receive only” in sh ip bgp longer-prefixes output
     -> sh ip bgp 192.0.2.0 255.255.255.0 longer-prefixes
     -> sh ip bgp 192.0.2.0 255.255.255.0
 - path is not synchronized and synchronization is enabled
 - path is denied by inbound BGP policies or inbound soft reset is configured
     -> bgp soft-reconfig-backup
          -> configure soft reconfiguration for peers that do not support the route refresh capability
     -> neighbor 192.0.2.1 soft-reconfiguration inbound
 - route is dampened
 - backdoor routes configured with the network backdoor command are not advertised in BGP updates
 - RR will not reflect routes when no bgp client-to-client reflection is configured
 - routes will be discarded if the AS_PATH exceeds the bgp maxas-limit when configured
 - routes will be discarded if the number of communities exceeds the bgp maxcommunity-limit when configured
 - routes will be discarded if the number of extended communities exceeds the bgp maxextcommunity-limit when configured
 - BGP-Origin AS Validation is configured and a prefix is marked as invalid, it will not be advertised, will be withdrawn from the 
   BGP routing table, will not be considered as a bestpath, and will not be considered as a candidate for multipath 
 - BGP-Origin AS Validation is configured and a prefix is marked as not found, it will only be considered for bestpath or a candidate
   for multipath if there is no alternative prefix that is marked valid

Best Path Algorithm:
 note: if extended community cost is configured for pre-bestpath, compare before anything else
     -> lowest is best
     -> set extcommunity cost pre-bestpath <community-id> <cost>
     -> bgp bestpath cost-community ignore
         -> this command was intended only to assist in troubleshooting path selection

- Important, next hop needs to be valid

- It’s not that difficult to remember whether higher or lower is best.  With the first two (weight and local_preference), highest is best.  
  Everything else, lowest, shortest, or oldest is best.

- If the ADD-PATH capability is used to send and receive additional paths, the best path algorithm is still used to select the best path,
  the 2nd "best" path, and the 3rd "best" path.
- If the Prefix Independent Convergence (PIC) feature is used to select a backup path, the best path algorithm is still used to select
  the best and backup paths.
- The steps below include the IOS configuration commands that can modify the default behavior of each step.


 1.  weight
     -> highest is best
     -> Cisco proprietary
     -> not actually a BGP attribute
     -> locally significant to the router
     -> range 0 to 65,535
     -> default is 0 for received routes
     -> default is 32768 for locally generated routes

     -> neighbor 192.0.2.1 weight 40000
     -> route-map WEIGHT permit 10
     ->   set weight 40000
     -> neighbor 192.0.2.1 route-map WEIGHT in
     -> neighbor 192.0.2.1 default-originate route-map WEIGHT in
     -> network 192.0.2.0 mask 255.255.255.0 route-map WEIGHT
         -> This works.  As does applying the route-map to the redistribute and aggregate-address commands.  But why would you do this to 
            locally originated routes since it’s only locally significant.


 2.  local_preference
     -> highest is best
     -> well-known, discretionary attribute LOCAL_PREF
     -> significant only in the local (internal) AS
     -> range 0 to 4294967295
     -> default 100 for every route
     
     -> bgp default local-preference 200
     -> change the default local-preference
     
     -> route-map LP permit 10
     ->   set local-preference 200
     -> neighbor 192.0.2.1 route-map LP out
     -> neighbor 192.0.2.1 default-originate route-map LP
     -> redistribute eigrp 1 route-map LP
     -> redistribute ospf 1 route-map LP match internal external 1 external 2
     -> network 192.0.2.0 mask 255.255.255.0 route-map LP
     -> aggregate-address 192.0.2.0 255.255.255.252 attribute-map LP
     
     -> to clear or reset the LOCAL_PREF sent by a peer, set to the default value
     -> route-map CLEAR_LP permit 10
     ->   set local-preference 100
     -> neighbor 192.0.2.1 route-map CLEAR_LP in


 3.  locally originated path
     -> locally generated routes are preferred over received routes
     -> default-originate
          -> configured per neighbor
          -> neighbor 192.0.2.1 default-originate
          -> advertise a default route to the neighbor, even if one is not currently in the RIB
     -> default-information originate
          -> configured per address family
          -> add a default route to the BGP table and advertise to all neighbors, even if one is not currently in the RIB
     -> network command
          -> network 0.0.0.0
          -> if 0.0.0.0 is present in the RIB, add to BGP table and advertise to all neighbors
     -> aggregate-address command
          -> summary-only
          -> advertise only the aggregate address, suppress longer prefixes
          -> aggregate-address 10.11.0.0 255.255.0.0 summary-only
          -> the aggregate-timer is set to 30 seconds by default.  new, longer prefixes may be briefly advertised until 
             the aggregate-timer runs
             -> the new, longer-prefix will then be withdrawn from the neighbors.
          -> if this may be a problem, such as in data centers or if the longer prefix can slip through policies or filters on 
             other routers, bgp aggregate-timer 0
     -> redistribute command


 3a.  Accumulated Interior Gateway Protocol (AIGP)
     -> lowest is best
     -> significant only in the local (internal) AS
     -> AIGP is an optional, non-transitive attribute
     -> range 0 - 4294967295
     -> AIGP path compared to AIGP path, the value of the AIGP metric is added to the metric towards the next-hop
     -> AIGP path compared to non-AIGP path, path with AIGP attribute is preferred
     -> Using AIGP with non-AIGP capable neighbors
        -> AIGP can be translated to a cost community
            -> The cost community point of insertion (POI) is specified
                -> Pre-bestpath
                -> IGP metric
        -> AIGP can be translated to MED
        
     -> bgp bestpath aigp ignore
     
     -> route-map AIGP permit 10
     ->  set aigp-metric igp-metric
     ->  set aigp-metric 100
     -> neighbor 192.0.2.1 aigp
     -> neighbor 192.0.2.1 route-map AIGP out
     -> redistribute bgp 100 route-map AIGP
     -> neighbor 192.0.2.1 send-community both
     -> neighbor 192.0.2.1 aigp send cost-community 100 poi igp-cost transitive
     -> neighbor 192.0.2.1 aigp send cost-community 100 poi pre-bestpath transitive
     -> neighbor 192.0.2.1 aigp send med
     -> neighbor 192.0.2.1 path-attribute treat-as-withdraw 26 in
         -> all prefixes in the UPDATE are removed from the BGP routing table
         -> path-attribute treat-as-withdraw cannot be used with most attributes
     -> neighbor 192.0.2.1 path-attribute discard 26 in
         -> drop the AIGP path attribute, then process the UPDATE as usual
         -> path-attribute discard cannot be used with most attributes


 4.  AS_PATH
     -> shortest is best
     -> significant external to AS
     -> range of 1 - 255 
     -> well-known mandatory attribute AS_PATH
     -> primary purpose is to provide loop prevention for inter-AS routing
     
     -> bgp bestpath as-path ignore
     
     -> route-map PREPEND permit 10
     ->   set as-path prepend 100 100
     -> neighbor 192.0.2.1 route-map PREPEND out
     
     -> neighbor 192.0.2.1 local-as 99
     -> local-as is intended to help with BGP ASN or ISP migrations
     -> local-as number must be different than the local AS and the peer AS
     -> local-as will be added to the AS_PATH making it longer
     -> neighbor 192.0.2.1 local-as 99 no-prepend
     -> local-as will not be added to the AS_PATH
     
     -> neighbor 192.0.2.1 remove-private-as
     -> removes private AS numbers from AS_PATH
     -> will cause the AS_PATH length to decrease

     -> neighbor 192.0.2.1 remove-private-as all replace-as
     -> replaces private AS numbers with router's local AS number
     -> will retain the AS_PATH length
     
     -> replaces any private AS in AS_PATH with router's local AS
     -> neighbor 192.0.2.1 as-override
     -> replaces the AS of the customer in AS_PATH with the AS of the provider
     -> used in address-family ipv4 vrf VRF_NAME or address-family ipv6 vrf VRF_NAME

     -> Note-to-self:  This is out of place.  Need to find a new home for this.

     -> neighbor 192.0.2.1 soo 64496:64511
     -> route-map SOO permit 10
     ->     set extcommunity soo 64496:645111
     -> neighbor 192.0.2.1 route-map SOO in
     
     -> neighbor 192.0.2.1 allowas-in
     -> accept an AS_PATH that contains the local AS
     
     -> route-map REPLACE_AS permit 10
     ->     set as-path replace 100
     -> neighbor 192.0.2.1 route-map REPLACE_AS in
     -> replace the AS 100 in AS_PATH with the local AS
     -> feature added in IOS XE 17.1.1
     -> note:  the AS_PATH length is not changed
     
     -> route-map REPLACE_AS permit 10
     ->     set as-path replace any
     -> neighbor 192.0.2.1 route-map REPLACE_AS in
     -> replace all AS listed in AS_PATH with the local AS
     -> note:  the AS_PATH length is not changed
     -> an AS_PATH of 123 234 345 456 567 becomes 100 100 100 100 100

     -> to strip the AS_PATH and replace with only the local AS, configure a locally originated path
     -> ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 192.0.2.1 name STRIP_AS_PATH_INFORMATION
     -> network 0.0.0.0
     -> an AS_PATH of 123 234 345 456 567 becomes 100
     
     -> aggregate-address summary-only
     -> causes the loss of individual path attributes, such as AS_PATH, replaced only with the local AS
     -> aggregate-address 10.11.0.0 255.255.0.0 summary-only
     
     -> aggregate-address summary-only with as-set
     -> causes the path information from the individual paths to be retained and summarized in a set, 300 {200,100}
     -> aggregate-address 10.11.0.0 255.255.0.0 summary-only as-set


 5.  ORIGIN
     -> lowest type is best
     -> significant external to AS
     -> well-known mandatory attribute ORIGIN
     -> IGP is lower (better) than EGP, EGP is lower (better) than INCOMPLETE
     -> IGP
          -> network command
     -> EGP
          -> predecessor to BGP
          -> historically, used to to transition from EGP to BGP
          -> the "set origin egp" command was removed in IOS 12.4(2)T
     -> INCOMPLETE
          -> redistribute command
          
     -> route-map ORIGIN permit 10

     -> optional non-transitive attribute MULTI_EXIT_DISC
     -> range 0 to 4,294,967,295
     -> default is 0 for received routes
         -> when MED is not assigned
     -> set to the value of the IGP metric for routes injected into BGP
         -> network or redistribute commands
     -> if the injected route is a connected route, set the MED to 0
         -> network or redistribute commands
     -> if the route was injected by the aggregate-address command, set the MED to 0
     -> used to influence a neighboring AS with multiple entry points
     -> or a neighboring AS may be influencing the local AS with multiple entry points
     -> compared only if the first AS in the AS_SEQUENCE is the same for multiple paths
     -> confederation sub-ASs are ignored unless configured
     
     -> bgp deterministic-med
         -> compare routes advertised by different peers in the same AS
     
     -> bgp always-compare-med

     -> route-map MED permit 10
     ->   set metric 100
     
     -> route-map MED permit 10
     ->   set metric-type internal
         -> if a border router learns a route from an iBGP peer, set the metric to the IGP cost instead of removing MED from the 
            UPDATE sent to the eBGP peer

     ->   set metric-type external

     -> bgp dynamic-med-interval 60
       -> by default, BGP will change the MED value associated with a prefix and re-advertise if necessary every 600 seconds
       -> interval range from 60 seconds to 136 years ( 4,294,967,295 seconds ).  in other words, never uptime.


 7.  eBGP over iBGP
     -> paths that contain AS_CONFED_SEQUENCE and AS_CONFED_SET are considered internal
     -> locally significant to the router ( Loc-RIB )


 8.  IGP metric to the BGP next hop
     -> lowest is best
     -> locally significant to the router ( Loc-RIB )
     
     -> bgp bestpath igp-metric ignore
         -> address-family command
         -> must be used when the Diverse Path feature is used and the route-reflector and shadow route-reflector are not co-located
         -> in this case, configured on the RR, shadow RR, and PE routers


8a.  extended community cost
     -> IGP point of insertion (POI)
     -> lowest is best

         -> aggregate-address 192.0.2.0 255.255.255.252 attribute-map EXTCOMMUMITYCOST


9.  multipath
     -> if multiple paths match the above steps
     -> determine if multiple paths require installation into the routing table
     -> default, only one best path is installed into the routing table
     -> even with multipath, the router still designates one of the paths as the best path and advertises this best path to it's neighbors
     -> the following need to be equal for multipath
        -> weight
        -> local preference
        -> AS-PATH length
        -> origin
        -> MED
        -> neighboring AS or sub-AS
        -> AS-PATH
           -> unless bgp bestpath as-path multipath-relax is configured
        -> for eBGP multipath
           -> learned from an external or confederation-external neighbor
           -> the IGP metric to the BGP next hop must be equal to the best-path IGP metric
        -> for iBGP multipath
           -> learned from an internal neighbor
           -> the IGP metric to the BGP next hop must be equal to the best-path IGP metric
              -> unless unequal-cost iBGP multipath is configured
              -> for unequal-cost load balancing, BGP Link Bandwidth can be used
                 -> bgp dmzlink-bw

     -> maximum-paths eibgp 2
        -> install parallel iBGP and eBGP routes

     -> bgp bestpath as-path mutlipath-relax
        -> hidden command in older IOS versions
        -> if multipath is configured and multiple routes have different AS in the path, but the AS_PATH lengths are the same (parallel paths),  
           install the multiple paths into the routing table
           -> solves a problem with BGP in data center CLOS networks described in RFC 7938


 10.  oldest route
     -> when multiple paths are external, prefer the path that was received first
     -> oldest is best
     -> locally significant to the router ( Loc-RIB )
     -> this step can be skipped by forcing BGP to compare router-ids
     
     -> bgp bestpath compare-router-id


 11.  router-id
     -> lowest is best
     -> locally significant to the router ( Loc-RIB )
     -> not the same thing as the ORIGINATOR_ID attribute, which is used by route reflectors
     -> ORIGINATOR_ID is an optional, non-transitive attribute
     -> ORIGINATOR_ID is compared instead of the router-id when route reflector attributes are present


 12.  cluster length
     -> lowest is best
     -> locally significant to the router ( Loc-RIB )
     -> CLUSTER_LIST is an optional, non-transitive attribute
     -> lowest CLUSTER_LIST length
     -> router reflectors only


 13.  neighbor address
     -> lowest is best
     -> locally significant to the router ( Loc-RIB )
     -> remote peer used in the TCP connection
