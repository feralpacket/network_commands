! have that annoying stack cable with lots of CRC errors because the onsite tech didn't seat the cable properly?
! disable the stack port until they can go back and fix it.  helps keep the switches in the switch stack from
! unexpectedly reloading on their own.
! interestingly, the CRC errors will still increase even though the stack port is down.  even if you disable both ends of the cable.

! reload command, the console port, and switch stacks
! the reload command will cause another switch in the stack to become the active switch and then reload the entire stack.
! the new active switch will remain the active switch even after the reload, ignoring any switch priority configuration.
! annoying, right?  (note:  this behavior is probably IOS XE version specific )  this means you lose console access to 
! the switch stack until you or someone else can move the console cable to the active switch.
! fix, use the redundacy reload shelf command
